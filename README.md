# Python Projects
- Project No. 1
- BRIEF - We were asked to write a program that allows a user to enter his favourite starter, main course, dessert and drink. It had to output a message which said, "Your favourite meal is ..... with a glass of .....".
- USING PYTHON AND VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #Function to ask a user what their favourite starter, main, dessert and drink is
              #Asks for each of these in 4 separate vaiables
              #Displays the users favourite meal and drink
- CHALLENGES FACED - I had trouble installing the ide as I found that using a Mac and working with programming languages was quite a challenge. 
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I did a lot of research on what the best course of action was, I also had some discussions with my tutor Ruth who helped me through it. After a lot of reading and troubleshooting using other peoples experiences with using Mac and VSC I finally got the code to run.
