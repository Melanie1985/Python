# Python Projects
- Project No. 1 - Favourite Meal
- BRIEF - We were asked to write a program that allows a user to enter his favourite starter, main course, dessert and drink. It had to output a message which said, "Your favourite meal is ..... with a glass of .....".
- USING PYTHON AND VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #Function to ask a user what their favourite starter, main, dessert and drink is
              #Asks for each of these in 4 separate vaiables
              #Displays the users favourite meal and drink
- CHALLENGES FACED - I had trouble installing the ide as I found that using a Mac and working with programming languages was quite a challenge. 
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I did a lot of research on what the best course of action was, I also had some discussions with my tutor Ruth who helped me through it. After a lot of reading and troubleshooting using other peoples experiences with using Mac and VSC I finally got the code to run.

- Project No. 2 - Motorbike
- BRIEF - We were asked to write a program that printed out the value of a Motorbike if it were to lose 10% of it's value each year. The bike cost £2000 and I had to print out the bike's value every year until it fell below £1000.
- USING PYTHON AND VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #Create variables for the bike and the price
              #Print to terminal the bike and price
              #Print to terminal the bikes value after each year after it lost 10% of         its value
- CHALLENGES FACED - I could not for the life of me think how to use / or * to get the 10% value to work all the way through my code. I could figure it out for the first year but after that I kept drawing a blank.  
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - As I was still new to python the best way I thought to get around this was to wrk out myself what 10% off each years price would be and then use that sum for the program. Not the most effective way to use Python but the work and final product worked.

- Project No. 3 - Joke
- BRIEF - We were asked to write a program that asks a user for their favourite number and then tells them a joke. We needed the function to accept one numeric parameter and use it to choose the joke to tell. 
- USING PYTHON AND VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #Create variable for the input 
              #If statement to see if num inputted is equal to 1
              #Elif statements to go through the numbers 2-10
              #Else statement for when inputted num doesnt match 
              #Print to terminal the joke that is equal to the number inputted
- CHALLENGES FACED - Finding the jokes for the 10 different options was quite a challenge in itself. I also wasn't sure how many elif statements were allowed and if the code would run.  
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I did a lot of reading on if, else, elif statements to make sure that the way I was writing the program was the most effecient way to do it.

- Project No. 4 - Palindrome
- BRIEF - We were asked to write a program that takes in a word and says whether or not it is a palindrome (a word that is the same backwards as forwards)
- USING PYTHON AND VISUAL STUDIO CODE
- SUDO CODE - #Create a program that finds out if a word is a palindrome or not
              #User is asked to input a word
              #If statement asks if the string is equal to string to use the string   reverse method
              #if the string is the same reversed then print It is a palindrome
              #else statement will print it is not if the conditions are not met
- CHALLENGES FACED - I wasn't sure how I was going to write code that took in a word and saw if it was the same forwards as it was backwards. I did have a few different tries using a few different methods but this is the code that worked for me.
- HOW I OVERCAME THIS CHALLENGE - I did a lot of reading and research and quickly discovered that there were a few different ways to see if a string was the same forwards as it was backwards.
